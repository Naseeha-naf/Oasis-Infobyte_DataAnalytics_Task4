# Sentiment Analysis 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that classifies text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This helps in understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and social media trends.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of textual data and corresponding sentiment labels. Each text entry is categorized as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Cleaned the text by removing punctuation, special characters, and stopwords.
3. Converted text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Trained a Naive Bayes classifier.
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.
7. Visualized sentiment distribution and results.

## Results
The model successfully classified sentiments with good accuracy. The confusion matrix and visualizations clearly show the model's performance across different sentiment classes.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of NLP and machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis. It provides meaningful insights into textual data and can be extended using advanced models in the future.
